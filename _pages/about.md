## About Me

I am currently a **Ph.D. student at Southeast University**, focusing on **high-precision positioning** and **multi-source information fusion** for intelligent transportation systems.  

My research interests lie in **multi-source fusion localization**, **autonomous driving**, and **vehicle–road–cloud collaborative positioning** in complex urban and low-altitude environments. I aim to enhance the **robustness**, **accuracy**, and **real-time performance** of navigation and localization algorithms under **GNSS-degraded or denied conditions**.  

During my master’s studies, I conducted extensive research on **GNSS carrier phase–based positioning**, including **cycle slip detection and repair**, as well as **tight coupling of GNSS and IMU systems**. Building upon this foundation, my current work explores the integration of **heterogeneous sensors** (e.g., LiDAR, cameras, IMU, GNSS) and **deep learning models** to improve the reliability and adaptability of **navigation and perception** in autonomous systems.  

Beyond research, I am passionate about **intelligent transportation**, **urban mobility**, and the **application of AI-driven sensor fusion** in real-world navigation scenarios. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of **robust, scalable, and intelligent localization systems** that support safer and more efficient autonomous transportation.
