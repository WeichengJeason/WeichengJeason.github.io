## About Me

I am currently a **Ph.D. student at Southeast University**, focusing on **High-precision positioning** and **Multi-source information fusion** for Intelligent transportation systems.  

My research interests lie in **Multi-source fusion localization**, **Autonomous driving**, and **Vehicle‚Äìroad‚Äìcloud collaborative positioning** in complex urban and low-altitude environments. I aim to enhance the **robustness**, **accuracy**, and **real-time performance** of navigation and localization algorithms under **GNSS-degraded or denied conditions**.  

During my master‚Äôs studies, I conducted extensive research on **GNSS carrier phase‚Äìbased positioning**, including **Cycle slip detection and repair**, as well as **Tight coupling of GNSS and IMU systems**. Building upon this foundation, my current work explores the integration of **Heterogeneous sensors** (e.g., LiDAR, cameras, IMU, GNSS) and **Deep learning models** to improve the reliability and adaptability of **Navigation and perception** in autonomous systems.  

Beyond research, I am passionate about **Intelligent transportation**, **Urban mobility**, and the **Application of AI-driven sensor fusion** in real-world navigation scenarios. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of **robust, scalable, and intelligent localization systems** that support safer and more efficient autonomous transportation.
